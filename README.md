## PyData 2013 - Intro to Network Science

This is the code from my talk ["Intro to Network Science"][talk] talk at [PyData][pydata] 2013.

### Requirements

- [Networkx][networkx]
- [Matplotlib][matplotlib]

### Running the code

To run the code, just run the `govtrack.py` script with the number for the meeting of congress and name of the house of congress that you wish to study. So, for example, to study the Senate for the 112th congress, you can simply run the following command:

    $ python govtrack.py 112 senate
  
To see an explanation of how the script works and the options available, just execute the script with the `-h` option.
