Blumenthal has worked with lots of people (high degree) and looks relatively important form the degree side, but when taking a look at the betweenness graph, he seems less important since the majority of his strong ties are between other democrats.

On the degree graph, the independents (sanders and lieberman) look somewhat important, but when viewed on the betweenness graph, their relative importance drops siginificantly.

Likewise, Murkowski shows up on the low-end of moderate players on the degree graph, but when viewed on the betweenness graph, her very strong tie with fellow state senator and opposing party member Begich makes a key player if you were trying to get bipartisan support for a bill.

This page started out as a bit of code that I wrote for my talk on network science at [PyData 2013][pydata] (Silicon Valley). It was meant to serve as a simple example of how to apply social network analysis techniques to a real world dataset. After the talk, I decided to get the code cleaned up a bit so that I could release it for anyone who had seen the talk, or anyone who might have a general interest in the topic. As I worked at cleaning the code up, I started adding a few little features here and there and started to think about how I could make the visualization easier to execute since Matplotlib can sometimes be a bit burdensome to install. The solution was to display the visualization in the browser. This way it could viewed without needing to install a bunch of third-party Python libraries.

In this section, quickly describe what the graph shows and how to interact with it.

## Graph topography

Just by looking at the network, without resizing the nodes relative to some measure of importance, we can already take away some interesting tidbits. The first thing I noticed when looking at the graph is that there are quite a few more ties between members of the Democratic Party than there are between their Republican counterparts. In addition, it also appears as if the individual ties themselves are stronger on the Democratic side. Given these observations, and your political party affiliation, you could come up with a few different stories to explain these discrepancies. If your vote tends to fall more towards the Democratic side of the aisle, you might say that the Democrats are simply working harder and producing more legislation while the Replublicans are being obstructionists as always. However, if your political preferences tend to lean a little further right, you could say that the Republicans, having a fundamental belief in small government, are purposefully keeping the number of proposed bills down, and that, of course, quantity does not equal quality.

Now, you'll need to take these observations with a grain of salt as I've purposefully cut out all of the links between nodes that had a weight of 10 (based on the number of bills worked on together) or lower in order to make the visualization perform tolerably, and also to make it possible to visually analyze the relationships in the graph. With that taken into account, it could be possible that the republican side of the senate has many more "weak" ties suggesting that they have indeed worked on several bills together, but they tend to work with a multitude of people rather than a select bunch.

The last thing that I want you to see before we move onto the centrality measurements is the quality of the connections between the legislators. The intensity of each edge in the graph is relative to its weight, so the darker the line, the more bills a pair of legistrators have worked on together. Given that knowledge, you'll notice a couple of things in the graph. First, whenever you hover over a node in the graph, the node, and it's immediate neighborhood, will be highlighted allowing you to better observe the relationships that the senator behind the node has formed with his/her colleagues. Looking at several nodes this way, you'll no doubt observe a pattern whereby the strongest connection for a node tends to be with the other senator from the same state. Second, one relationship in particular always stands out to me, and that is the one between Sen. Lisa Murkowski [R-AK] and her partner in the senate, Sen. Mark Begich [D-AK]. This one is interesting because you have two senators from the same state who, with the interests of their home state in mind, have formed a strong working relationship with one another despite their opposing party affiliations. Though we've just seen how a network visualiztion can begin to help us ferret out important relationships such as this one, we'll see a little later on, just how important this type of relationhip can be when viewed with the right metric.

# Degree

Now that we've got a decent overview of the relationships in our network, let's take a look at a couple of different metrics for determining the relative importance of each node in the graph. We'll start with degree, which is essentially nothing more than the number of nodes a node is connected to, or, keeping within the realm of our experiment, it's the number of senators each senator has previously worked with. To view the degree, just select it in the dropdown in the upper right corner of the visualization. Once you've switched the visualization to show the degree for each node, you should begin to notice a few additional characteristics of the network.

First, the degree gives us further confirmation of one of our earlier observations, namely that the Democrats seem to have authored more bills during the 112th session of Congress than their Republican counterparts. Overall, the nodes on the Democrat's side are larger than those of the Republicans, suggesting that they have more working relationships with their colleagues, and from that we can conclude that they have more relationships because they've worked on more bills. The more interesting take away though, is that we can begin to see who the key players in Congress are. As I stated earlier, the larger the node, the more relationships that senator has, and arguably the more influence that senator has as well. So, if you are member of the Senate hoping to get a bill passed, or perhaps the President himself, rather than wasting time hitting up each and every senator for support, you may want to target the hubs (those members with the largest number of connections) and let them work their magic on the colleagues that they've worked with in the past.

With respect to the observations I've made above, I'd again like to point out that you should obviously take each into consideration with a healhty dose of skepticism. I am, by far, not an expert in politics, nor sociology, for that matter, and I am sure that my views and comments are at least somewhat skewed by my political beliefs. In addition, I'd like to point out that, though the degree itself should be fairly unbiased since it's only for one session of Congress and not a cummulative total, it can be assumed that senators that have been in Congress for a while and who have developed several long standing relationships with their colleagues will most likely have an advantage over "rookies" in the Senate, and so will likely have a higher degree. So, the remarks I've made in the last section could actually be highly skewed if the number of experienced players a political party has differs greatly.

# Betweeness

I have one last metric I want to discuss, but as a way of introduction, I'd like to start off with an example of how it could be useful. Let's say you're a Democrat who wants to sponsor a bill that will probably alienate several members of your own party. Given your predicament, you're going to need as much support from the opposite side of the aisle as you can possibly muster. There's a problem with this situation though, both sides like to keep to themselves. I'm not really going out on a limb here when I say that, cross-party cooperation wasn't necessarily the strongest characteristic of this particular session of congress. So, given your situation, how do you go about getting the most votes from the opposing side with the least amount of effort? Well, you target the members that have the most influence within their party of course. As we've already seen, degree can be a very good indicator of which nodes have a decent amount of influence within the network. However, targeting those nodes with the highest degree may not be the best course of action for you, since, in many cases, you may just be targeting members who tend only want to work with other members of their own party. Preferably you want someone who has high influence, but also a proven track record of working with members across the aisle. In that case, you may want to take a look at betweenness.

Betweenness is a measure of a node's importance relative to the number of shortest paths on which that node resides. If you're not used to thinking of a network of human relationships as a graph (in the mathematical sense), the concept of a shortest path might seem a bit foreign to you, but don't worry, it's an easy concept to grasp. In fact, if you've ever asked a relative for help in finding a job, you're already quite familiar with the concept. That uncle, or aunt, or family friend that you asked for help, more than likely, had to make an introduction for you to someone that could actually give you a job. In this scenario, the person you asked for help is on the shortest path between you and the person making the hiring decisions at your desired place of employment, otherwise, you probably would have asked someone else for help. With that example, you're probably starting to see importance of the betweenness metric, essentially it helps you find the gatekeepers in the network, or those individuals that can most help, or hinder, your ability to form relationships with members of a community to which you do not currently belong. These gatekeeper members of the Senate are who we're currently looking for since they bridge the divide between parties. To see these gatekeepers, select Betweenness from the dropdown in the upper right corner.

With the nodes resized relative to their betweenness we get yet another look at who the most influential senators are and we can make serveral more interesting observations. If we stick with the scenario described above, we immediately see that three senators stand out on the Repbulican side as the gatekeepers in the group: Senators Marco Rubio, David Vitter, and John Thrune. If I were trying to get my bill passed, I might want to target these three the hardest, because if just one were support my bill, they would, hopefully, bring a large number of their constituents with them. Another thing I noticed when making the switch between degree and betweenness is just how little influence the independent senators (the grey nodes) have from a betweeness point of view. Both Sen. Joseph Lieberman and Sen. Bernie Sanders showed a decent amount of influence when viewing the degree-based graph, but when viewing the nodes resized according to their betweenness, their importance becomes miniscule. Finally, the node that I found to be the most interesting was that of Sen. Olympia Snowe. She continuously shows up on the Democratic side of the network due to her multitude of strong relationships with many Senate Democrats. For this reason, I completely expected her to gain in influence when viewed from the point of view of betweenness, however, contrary to my prediction, her influence actually decreased slightly. The best explanation I can come up with for her diminished influence in the betweenness graph is that she was simply too bipartisan. She was so willing to work with the Democrats, that her influence within her own party was severly hindered. Unfortunatley, for Miss Snowe, in a Senate so starkly divided on party lines, the one voice of compromise and bipartisanship is not readily rewarded. This theory seems to make sense since it has been pointed out [many][snowe_1] [times][snowe_2] [now][snow_3] that this lack of willingness to work together lead to her decision to resign.
